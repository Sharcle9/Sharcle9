- 👋 Hi, I’m Charles
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineer and data science
- 😵‍💫 I got my BA in Comp Sci and Math @ Rutgers University in 2020. I got my MA in Math @ UNL in Winter 2021. So it has been a while since I worked on a big project
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the PhD program for mathmatics, but I'd like to improve my programming skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun small projects
- 📫 You can reach me at sharcle91@outlook.com :)
